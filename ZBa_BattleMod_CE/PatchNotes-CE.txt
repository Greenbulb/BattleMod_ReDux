New ability: Air Dodge
	Press the parry button in midair to avoid damage
	It also gives a small boost in any direction

Modding functionality
	Added new skinvars: func_collide, func_precollide, func_postcollide, func_exhaust
		These can be set using CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skinname"].func_collide and CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skinname"].func_exhaust
		func_collide is run when the player collides with another player - it's useful for making certain moves behave uniquely on player contact!
		If func_collide returns true, collision physics will be overridden
		func_precollide runs before func_collide, and func_postcollide runs after Battle's collision physics happen
		func_exhaust is run during battlemod's exhaust code, and can return true in order to prevent exhaustion from resetting on floor touch - use it to give your custom abilities battlemod-specific exhaust limitations!
	Added universal mechanics supporting blockable projectiles
		"Blockable projectiles" are projectiles such as Fang's corks which only deal damage when the target has low enough defense
		You can create projectiles that are blockable by giving any missile these variables:
			mo.blockable - if set to a number, the target will need that much defense or more to block the shot
			mo.block_sound - sound to play when blocked. If it's not set, it will use the same sound effect as fang's corks
			mo.block_stun - amount of horizontal thrust to apply on block (will be multiplied by scale later)
			mo.block_hthrust - amount of horizontal thrust to apply on block (will be multiplied by scale later)
			mo.block_vthrust - amount of vertical thrust to apply on block (will be multiplied by scale later)
	Added mo.hit_sound for projectiles (sound to play on successful hit)
	Added the mo.cantouchteam variable, which allows for friendly projectiles to interact with teammates. This can be used for support purposes, like with love hearts
	Added the mo.name variable, which allows projectiles and other hazardous items to bypass the mo.info.name variable in the hitfeed
	Added support for SF_STOMPDAMAGE characters - they have a 1/1 sweetspot while falling

Maintenance

	Fixed an issue where Metal Sonic could float after using a bubble shield bounce or a lightning shield jump
	Fixed an issue where Metal Sonic would not exit the "spinning" state when using Energy Attack, which allowed him to attack during his falling animation
	Fixed an issue where using the bubble shield bounce would exhaust Metal Sonic
	Fixed an issue where bubble items were included in the blockmap
	Fixed an issue where elemental fire trails would drain rings from teammates on touch
	Fixed the accuracy of the HUD objective compass in all objective-based modes
