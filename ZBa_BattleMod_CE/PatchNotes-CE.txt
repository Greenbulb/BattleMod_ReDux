	These can be set using CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skin"].func_collide and CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skin"].func_exhaust
	func_collide is run when the player collides with another player - it's useful for making certain moves behave uniquely on player contact!
	If func_collide returns true, collision physics will be overridden
	func_exhaust is run during battlemod's exhaust code, and can return true in order to prevent exhaustion from resetting on floor touch - use it to give your custom abilities battlemod-specific exhaust limitations!

	Fixed an issue where elemental fire trails would drain rings from teammates on touch
	Fixed an issue where Amy was unable to escape CEZ swings
	Fixed the accuracy of the HUD objective compass in all objective-based modes
