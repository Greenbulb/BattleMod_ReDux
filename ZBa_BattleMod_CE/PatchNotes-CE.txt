	Changed the sound effects of collision interactions, adding more unique sounds for successful and defended attacks at different priority levels
	Added screenshake to collisions increasing based on the attack / defense priority
	Added a visual effect when a collison causes damage - the effect is larger for attacks with higher priority
	Bashable objects now play priority-based sound effects when attacked, and have collision visual effects

Item Bubbles
	Item bubbles can be used to bounce, but it's weaker than monitor bounces
	Item bubbles now play a sound effect when popped
	Item bubbles now create an icon when popped, like a monitor

Tails
	Tails exhausts more quickly
	When Tails is exhausted, his acceleration is halved
	Flight Dash's cooldown is increased depending on Tails's exhaustion level, up to 4x longer
	Tail Swipe's animation is shorter
	Tail Swipe's projectiles last longer: (35tics -> 45tics)
	Tail Swipe's projectiles have increased launch speed, can bounce off walls, can bounce off players, and decelerate while traveling
	All 3 of Tail Swipe's projectiles produce a sound effect instead of just the center one, although the sound is quieter for each
	Increased Tail Swipe cooldown: (1.25s -> 1.5s)

Knuckles
	Knuckles now exhausts while gliding, instead of only when climbing
	Knuckles now falls more quickly when gliding at very low speed
	While gliding, Knuckles behaves as if Legacy mode is disabled
	Slightly increased the knockback Knuckles recieves after hitting with Gliding Fists

Fang
	Added some recoil to grounded popgun
	Added a tiny bit of screenshake to popgun shots
	Adjusted the popgun firing sound effect

Metal Sonic
	When exhausted, Metal Sonic simply stops floating instead of overheating and slowing down

Misc.
	Increased the exhaustion rate of CEZ swings
	Parrying a player will remove their invincibility powerup
	Adjusted shield visuals, making most of them more translucent while making the whirlwind shield more opaque
	In team modes, all shields are team colored
	When a reserve shield is used, it plays a different sound effect depending on the type of shield
	Lowered the height at which Tails Doll floats

Modding functionality
	Added lua scripting features: func_collide, func_exhaust
	These can be set using CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skin"].func_collide and CBW_Battle.SkinVars["skin"].func_exhaust
	func_collide is run when the player collides with another player - it's useful for making certain moves behave uniquely on player contact!
	If func_collide returns true, collision physics will be overridden
	func_exhaust is run during battlemod's exhaust code, and can return true in order to prevent exhaustion from resetting on floor touch - use it to give your custom abilities battlemod-specific exhaust limitations!

Maintenance
	Fixed an issue where Metal Sonic could float after using a bubble shield bounce or a lightning shield jump
	Fixed an issue where using the bubble shield bounce would exhaust Metal Sonic
	Fixed an issue where elemental fire trails would drain rings from teammates on touch
	Fixed an issue where Amy was unable to escape CEZ swings
	Fixed the accuracy of the HUD objective compass in all objective-based modes
